## How to Use

### BFS - Shortest Path Visualization
1. **Setup**:
   - Click "Generate Random Maze" for a random maze
   - Or manually click on grid cells to toggle walls
   - Green cell = Start, Red cell = Goal

2. **Run Algorithm**:
   - Click "Start BFS" to begin visualization
   - Watch as BFS explores level by level (breadth-first)
   - Yellow cells = Frontier (currently being explored)
   - Blue cells = Visited
   - Orange path = Shortest path found

3. **Controls**:
   - Adjust speed with the slider
   - Pause/Resume during execution
   - Reset to try again

### DFS - Cycle Detection
1. **Setup**:
   - Click "Generate Random Graph" for a random directed graph
   - Click "Add Cycle" to intentionally create cycles
   - Or manually create nodes (click) and edges (drag between nodes)

2. **Run Algorithm**:
   - Click "Start DFS" to begin cycle detection
   - Watch as DFS explores deeply (depth-first)
   - Yellow nodes = Currently visiting
   - Blue nodes = Completely visited
   - Red nodes/edges = Cycle detected

3. **Understanding the Visualization**:
   - Numbers below nodes show discovery/finish times
   - Red highlighted elements indicate detected cycles
   - Statistics show total cycles found

## Algorithm Details

### Breadth-First Search (BFS)
- **Time Complexity**: O(V + E) where V = vertices, E = edges
- **Space Complexity**: O(V) for the queue
- **Guarantees**: Finds shortest path in unweighted graphs
- **Use Cases**: 
  - Shortest path in unweighted graphs
  - Level-order tree traversal
  - Social network analysis (degrees of separation)
  - Web crawling

### Depth-First Search (DFS)
- **Time Complexity**: O(V + E) where V = vertices, E = edges
- **Space Complexity**: O(V) for the recursion stack
- **Cycle Detection**: Uses white/gray/black coloring
  - White (unvisited) ‚Üí Gray (visiting) ‚Üí Black (visited)
  - Back edge to gray node indicates cycle
- **Use Cases**:
  - Cycle detection in directed graphs
  - Topological sorting
  - Finding strongly connected components
  - Dependency resolution

## Customization

### Adding New Algorithms
To add a new algorithm visualizer:

1. Create a new JavaScript file (e.g., `dijkstra.js`)
2. Implement the algorithm class following the existing pattern
3. Add UI elements to `index.html`
4. Update `main.js` to handle the new algorithm
5. Add appropriate styling to `styles.css`

### Modifying Visualizations
- Colors can be customized in the `colors` object of each visualizer
- Animation speeds are controlled by the `speedToDelay()` function
- Grid/canvas sizes can be adjusted in the constructor parameters

## Performance Notes

- **Grid Size**: BFS visualization uses a 30x20 grid by default for optimal performance
- **Graph Size**: DFS visualization handles 6-10 nodes efficiently
- **Animation**: Uses `requestAnimationFrame` for smooth animations
- **Memory**: Automatic cleanup prevents memory leaks during repeated runs

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Algorithm not starting**: 
   - Ensure start and goal positions are set (BFS)
   - Ensure graph has nodes (DFS)

2. **Slow performance**:
   - Increase animation speed using the slider
   - Close other browser tabs
   - Use a modern browser

3. **Visual glitches**:
   - Refresh the page
   - Clear browser cache
   - Ensure JavaScript is enabled

### Support
For questions or issues:
- Check the browser console for error messages
- Ensure all files are in the correct directory structure
- Verify that JavaScript is enabled in your browser
